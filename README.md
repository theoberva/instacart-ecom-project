# **Optimizing Product Promotions and Recommendations at Instacart**

> # Overview
>
> Whether you shop from meticulously planned grocery lists or let whimsy guide your grazing, our unique food rituals define who we are. Instacart, a grocery ordering and delivery app, aims to make it easy to fill your refrigerator and pantry with your personal favorites and staples when you need them. After selecting products through the Instacart app, personal shoppers review your order and do the in-store shopping and delivery for you.

> For each order_id in the test set, you should predict a space-delimited list of product_ids for that order. If you wish to predict an empty order, you should submit an explicit 'None' value. You may combine 'None' with product_ids. The spelling of 'None' is case sensitive in the scoring metric.

Instacart’s data science team plays a big part in providing this delightful shopping experience. Currently they use transactional data to develop models that predict which products a user will buy again, try for the first time, or add to their cart next during a session. Recently, Instacart open sourced this data - see their blog post on 3 Million Instacart Orders, Open Sourced.

In this competition, Instacart is challenging the Kaggle community to use this anonymized data on customer orders over time to predict which previously purchased products will be in a user’s next order. They’re not only looking for the best model, Instacart’s also looking for machine learning engineers to grow their team.

Winners of this competition will receive both a cash prize and a fast track through the recruiting process. For more information about exciting opportunities at Instacart, check out their careers page here or e-mail their recruiting team directly at ml.jobs@instacart.com.

## Objective:

_The objective of this project is to analyze the Instacart dataset to identify patterns in customer purchasing behavior and use these insights to optimize product promotions and recommendations._
<br>

1. **Data Preprocessing and Exploration** <br>
   Load the Instacart dataset.
   Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the structure of the data.
   Clean and preprocess the data, making it ready for analysis.
2. **Market Basket Analysis** <br>
   Transform the data into a transactional format.
   Use the Apriori algorithm or FP-growth to find association rules between products.
   Calculate support, confidence, and lift for each rule.
3. **Customer Segmentation** <br>
   Use clustering algorithms (such as K-means) to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.
   Alternatively, use Bayesian clustering techniques to incorporate prior knowledge.
4. **Personalized Product Recommendations** <br>
   Develop a product recommendation system using collaborative filtering.
   Implement Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) to make more accurate recommendations based on users’ past preferences and orders.
5. **Promotion Optimization Using Bayesian A/B Testing** <br>
   Simulate an A/B test scenario where two different promotions are tested on a subset of customers.
   Use Bayesian statistics to analyze the A/B test results and determine which promotion is more effective.
   Discuss how Bayesian analysis provides additional insights compared to traditional frequentist methods.
6. **Demand Forecasting and Inventory Optimization** <br>
   Use Bayesian structural time series models to forecast the demand for popular product combinations.
   Use these forecasts to make recommendations for inventory optimization.
7. **Visualization and Insights** <br>
   Visualize the association rules, customer segments, and A/B test results using plots and heatmaps.
   Summarize the insights gained from the analysis and how they can be used to optimize promotions and recommendations.
8. **Reporting and Documentation** <br>
   Write a comprehensive report or create a presentation that describes each step of the analysis, the methodologies used, the results obtained, and the insights and recommendations for Instacart.
